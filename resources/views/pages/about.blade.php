  <p> The University of the South (or Sewanee) is a large campus including a 13,000â€“acre space commonly referred to as 
      the  Domain. Sewanee's campus contains various flora and fauna, and the purpose of this website is to present information
    on the types of plants you can find here on the Domain. Sewanee has thousands of species of plants
    thus only the landscaping plants will be on this website, as listing all the species would be impossible.
  
      This is a project made by Emmanuel Oluloto, Class of 2019 (me). I wanted to get more experience with web design and 
    I also like plants, so I decided to create this website. I hope you find this website helpful!
  Thank you for your time!</p>

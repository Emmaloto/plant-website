# Sewanee Arboretum Plant Database

These are files for a website I created with the Laravel framework. It has functionality for viewing, inserting, 
editing and deleting into a database containing information on plants used for landscaping at Sewanee. 
  I created this to get some experience with the back and front end of web development, as well as working with
a web framework. The website is not yet live online, but hopefully it should be ready in the next few weeks.

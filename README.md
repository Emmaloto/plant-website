# Sewanee Arboretum Plant Database

## Description

These are files for a website I created with the Laravel framework. It has functionality for viewing, inserting, editing and deleting into a database containing information on plants used for landscaping at Sewanee. I created this to get some experience with the back and front end of web development, as well as working with a web framework. The website is not currently live online, but a demo will be available shortly  on my webiste: [My Website](https://emmanueloluloto.wixsite.com/emmaloto)
